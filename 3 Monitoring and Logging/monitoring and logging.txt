MONITOR CLUSTER COMPONENT

used to monitor pod level metric, cpu and memory consumption and other parameters

you can have a metric server on a cluster

a metric cluster receives metrics from kubernetes nodes and pods, aggregate them and store then in nmemory.

if you are using minikube, run the command 


minkube addons enable metrics-server
for other environment, deploy the the netric server by cloning the metric server deployment file from the github repository

git clone https://github.com/kubernetes-incubator/metrics-server, the deploying the required component using the kubectl command

kubectl create -f deploy/1.8+/
this command above deploys a set of pods and rules to make the metric server to pull for poerformance metrics from the node in the cluster

once deployed, give the metric server some time to process data.


to view cluster process, run the command 


kubectl top node 

this provides the cpu and memory consumption of the node

use;
 
kubectl top pod
 
to view performance mertrics of pod in kubernetes.
